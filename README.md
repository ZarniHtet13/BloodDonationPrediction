### Blood Donor Prediction

The goal of the project is more accurately predict blood donors using a modification of the Recency-Frequency-Monetary model.
The data set has five features with four predictors of
* Months since Last Donation
* Number of Donations
* Total Volume Donated
* Months since first donation

The dependent variable is a categorical variable of
* Made Donation in March 2007.

In the project, I have used
* SVM Linear
* SVM Kernel
* Logistic Regression with Cross Validation. I have also written my own Cross Validation function.
